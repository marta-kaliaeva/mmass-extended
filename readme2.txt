The extended version of mmass includes the following new features/extensions:
1. Separation of the "adduct" column in compound search, which previously contained both adducts and isotopes, into two separate columns: isotope and adduct.
2. Separation of adducts into subgroups and a change in the display format. Adducts are now shown as [adduct]+/-.
3. Creation of combinations of isotopes (13C) + isotope (15N). Another new feature is the display of the formula, where the combined adduct+isotope can now be seen.
4. A new column m/z measured has been added to the compound search table to compare this value with the m/z database.
5. The sorting system in the compound search table has been improved so that compounds can be sorted by m/z values from smallest to largest and vice versa. Sorting by compound name in alphabetical order is also possible.
6. Addition of cubic calibration.
7. Compound creation: Library creation from HMDB.
8. Minor formatting changes, such as adjusting decimal places, table sizes, column sizes, and text formatting.
